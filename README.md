# Disclaimer
This GPS might not be 100% accurate due to limitations. While we work on improving it, please bear with us :

EXAMPLE : Fastest way from Dover to Bishan would be Change at Buona Vista. However, the GPS is most likely going to tell you either change at City Hall or Jurong East. 

# SG MRT GPS

This lightweight application literally depends on only one thing:

# Todo

- Double Interchanges 

- Double Interchanges fastest legit route (ex. second location to alight at (ex2. CCL, to Kovan, alight at sgoon or dhoby ghaut or harbourfront faster?))

- Triple Interchanges (ex. Nibong to Airport)

- Legit fastest method (ex. Jurong East to Marina Bay, fastest way would be not direct.)

- Time estimator

- Station count

- More efficient routing

- For routing at where to change, consider distance to the end station after changing lines.

- Find total stations travelled in the end and find a fastest route
